## What is Rolly.js?

Rolly is a web library written in javascript for building pages that moves smoothly.

This library has been created with the idea of offering three features:
- change the behavior of the default scroll for a smoother effect
- quickly and flexibly add a customizable parallax effect to any element on a page
- create interaction scenes related to the scroll position in a page
